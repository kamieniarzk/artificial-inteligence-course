## Dataset 
The dataset used for training the classifiers was based on quality of wines, it is available [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009). The input consists of 11 numerical variables, including:
* `fixed acidity`
* `volatile acidity`
* `citric acid`
* `residual sugar`
* `chlorides`
* `free sulfur dioxide`
* `total sulfur dioxide`
* `density`
* `pH`
* `sulphates`
* `alcohol`

The output variable `quality` is an integer between 0 and 10. 

There are 2 classifiers implemented in our solution, including Support Vector Machine and Random Forest. The whole dataset consists of 1599 samples.
